  #To filter the movies by comedy, we're going to type WHERE, then list the condition, which is Genre.#

WHERE

   #Genre is a column in the dataset, and we only want to select rows where the cell in the Genre column exactly matches "Comedy." Since the data in the Genre column is a string format, we have to use single or double quotations when writing it. And keep in mind that ***capitalization matters here***, so we have to make sure that the letter casing matches the column name exactly. #

  Genre = 'Comedy'
